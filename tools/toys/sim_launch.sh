# A toy opened in the iOS Simulator with Metal's API validation on: the launch a Linux check can't
# make. The toy's shaders go through Apple's own Metal compiler and its every Metal call through
# Apple's validation layer (MTL_DEBUG_LAYER), which aborts on a misuse the phone's driver might crash
# on, naming it. Then it is left running and is asked whether it is still alive.

# It builds the toy for the Simulator (SIM=1 toys/ios/build.sh), boots an iPhone, installs and launches
# it, waits SECONDS_ALIVE (default 25) and fails if the toy is gone or logged a GPU error. <out-dir> keeps what it saw: the toy's
# own toy-log.txt (the kit's launch steps, its GPU errors), its stdout and stderr (Metal's validation
# messages), any crash report, and a screenshot. What it can't vouch for: the phone's memory limit
# (the Simulator has none of its own) and the phone's GPU (the Mac's draws for it): toy-log.txt from a
# phone stays the last word.
